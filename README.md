# deep-Learning-Semantic-segmentation-using-opencv

 you will learn how to perform semantic segmentation using OpenCV, deep learning, and the ENet architecture
 Semantic segmentation algorithms on the other hand attempt to:

Partition the image into meaningful parts
While at the same time, associate every pixel in an input image with a class label (i.e., person, road, car, bus, etc.)

. trained that dataset on The @ Cityscapes Dataset, a semantic, instance-wise, dense pixel annotation of 20-30 classes (depending on which model you’re using).
The particular model we’re using is trained on 20 classes, including:

Unlabeled (i.e., background)
Road
Sidewalk
Building
Wall
Fence
Pole
TrafficLight
TrafficSign
Vegetation
Terrain
Sky
Person
Rider
Car
Truck
Bus
Train
Motorcycle
Bicycle
